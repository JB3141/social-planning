# Social Planning

> A social planning application built with Node.js

## Architecture

**Status:** Early stage - architecture evolving

**Design Philosophy:**
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Build for clarity and maintainability
- Document decisions as they're made

## Technology Stack

**Backend:** Node.js (to be configured)
**Frontend:** To be determined
**Database:** To be determined
**Deployment:** To be determined

**Testing:** To be configured
**Build Tools:** To be configured

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Cleverness

**Why:** Code is read far more often than it's written. Simple, obvious solutions are easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

**Example:** Prefer explicit conditionals over complex ternaries. Choose clear variable names over short abbreviations.

**Applied:** To be demonstrated in first features

### 2. Test-Driven Development

**Coverage Target:** To be established based on project needs

**Testing Strategy:**
- Write tests as you build features
- Test business logic thoroughly
- Balance coverage with pragmatism
- Document testing patterns in CLAUDE.md

**Status:** Testing framework to be configured

### 3. Documentation as Code

**Knowledge Capture:**
- CLAUDE.md captures coding patterns and conventions
- llms.txt captures architecture decisions and principles
- Comments explain "why", not "what"
- README explains setup and usage

**Compounding Effect:** Each documented pattern makes future development faster

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

**Approach:** Build core functionality first, add enhancements incrementally

**Benefits:**
- Faster time to working prototype
- Easier to validate assumptions
- Clear upgrade path

## Key Decisions

### Decision Template

Use this template when documenting important decisions:

**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Context:** [Why it matters, what alternatives were considered]
**Date:** [When decided]
**Status:** Active | Superseded | Under Review

---

## API Design

**Status:** To be established

When API patterns emerge, document:
- Endpoint naming conventions
- Request/response formats
- Error handling approach
- Authentication/authorization
- Versioning strategy
- Rate limiting

---

## Database Design

**Status:** To be established

When database patterns emerge, document:
- Schema design principles
- Migration strategy
- Query optimization patterns
- Relationship modeling
- Data validation approach

---

## Security Considerations

**Status:** To be implemented

Security checklist:
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Authentication mechanism
- [ ] Authorization rules
- [ ] Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Security headers

**Document:** Security patterns as they're implemented

---

## Performance Guidelines

**Status:** To be established

Performance considerations:
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy
- [ ] Asset optimization
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring

**Document:** Performance patterns and benchmarks as you build

---

## Error Handling

**Status:** To be established

Error handling approach:
- Error types and classifications
- Logging strategy
- User-facing error messages
- Debug information capture
- Recovery strategies

**Document:** Error patterns as they emerge

---

## Development Workflow

**Compounding Engineering Process:**

1. **Plan:** Create detailed PRD in `tasks/` directory
2. **Work:** Execute systematically, update status in real-time
3. **Review:** Multi-agent code review before merging
4. **Learn:** Document patterns in CLAUDE.md and learnings in `knowledge/learnings/`

**Git Workflow:**
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: descriptive names
- Commit messages: clear, descriptive
- PRs: include context and testing notes

---

## Future Considerations

### Architecture

- [ ] Determine frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- [ ] Choose database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- [ ] Select hosting/deployment platform
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### Features

- [ ] Define core functionality
- [ ] Plan user authentication
- [ ] Design data models
- [ ] Establish API contracts

### Technical Debt

**Philosophy:** Track technical debt explicitly, pay it down regularly

- [ ] No known technical debt yet
